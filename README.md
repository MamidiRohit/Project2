## Boosting Trees
__* What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?__<br />
The gradient boosting tree I have implemented is one of the machine learning methods that can predict the regression. 
  
* How did you test your model to determine if it is working reasonably correctly?
  
* What parameters have you exposed to users of your implementation in order to tune performance? (Also perhaps provide some basic usage examples.)
  
* Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental?
