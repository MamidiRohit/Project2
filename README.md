# Gradient Boosting Algorithm from Scratch

## Introduction

This project implements the **Gradient Boosting Tree algorithm** from scratch in Python, closely following the descriptions in Sections 10.9-10.10 of *The Elements of Statistical Learning* (2nd Edition) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. The implementation supports both **regression** and **binary classification** tasks, providing a fit-predict interface similar to scikit-learn's models, allowing for easy integration and use on any dataset.

## Usage

### Installation

No external installation is required beyond the standard Python libraries. Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.11
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (only for testing and comparison purposes)


1. First setup virtualenv make sure you have virtualenv package (Inside root project directory)
```bash
virtualenv venv   # I used python 3.11
```
2. Activate it (In the same folder where venv has been created)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate 
```

2. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset in the form of NumPy arrays:

- `X`: A 2D NumPy array of shape `(n_samples, n_features)` containing the input features.
- `y`: A 1D NumPy array of shape `(n_samples,)` containing the target values (continuous for regression, class labels for classification).

Ensure that your data does not contain any NaN or infinite values unless you intend to handle missing values within the model.

### Examples

#### Regression Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the custom `GradientBoosting` for regression:

```python
import numpy as np
from gradient_boosting import GradientBoosting

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Features
y = np.sin(X).ravel() + np.random.randn(100) * 0.1  # Target with noise

# Introduce missing values
mask = np.random.rand(*X.shape) < 0.1  # 10% missing values
X[mask] = np.nan

# Split the data into training and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize and fit the model for regression
gb_reg = GradientBoosting(
    loss='squared_error',
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    handle_missing='mean'  # Options: 'none', 'mean', 'median'
)
gb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = gb_reg.predict(X_test)
gb_reg.plot_learning_curve("Professor given data")
# Evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print('Regression MSE:', mse)
```

#### Classification Example

Here's an example of how to use the custom `GradientBoosting` for binary classification:

```python
import numpy as np
from gradient_boosting import GradientBoosting

# Generate sample data for classification
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 2) * 10  # Features
y = (np.sin(X[:, 0]) + np.cos(X[:, 1]) > 1).astype(int)  # Binary target

# Introduce missing values
mask = np.random.rand(*X.shape) < 0.1  # 10% missing values
X[mask] = np.nan

# Split the data into training and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize and fit the model for classification
gb_clf = GradientBoosting(
    loss='logistic',
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    handle_missing='mean'  # Options: 'none', 'mean', 'median'
)
gb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
# plot graph 
gb_clf.plot_learning_curve("Graph name")
# Make predictions
y_pred = gb_clf.predict(X_test)
y_proba = gb_clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Evaluate the model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Classification Accuracy:', accuracy)
```

### Fixing Module Not Found Error

If you encounter a "module `gradient_boosting` not found" error, you can fix it by adding the module location to your Python path.

### For Linux/macOS

1. Open a terminal.

2. Use the `export` command to add the module path to `PYTHONPATH`. Replace `<project-root-location>` with the actual path to your project root.

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:<project-root-location>"
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/project"
   ```

### For Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. Use the `set` command to add the module path to `PYTHONPATH`. Replace `<project-root-location>` with the path to your project root.

   ```cmd
   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;<project-root-location>
   ```

   For example:

   ```cmd
   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\path\to\your\project
   ```

After running this command, Python should be able to locate the `gradient_boosting` module.

## Answers to the Questions

### 1. What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?

The implemented model is a **Gradient Boosting** algorithm that can perform both **regression** and **binary classification** tasks. It builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each new tree tries to correct the errors made by the previous ones by fitting to the negative gradients of the loss function.

**When to Use It**:

- **Regression Tasks**: Suitable for predicting continuous target variables.
- **Classification Tasks**: Suitable for binary classification problems.
- **Complex Relationships**: Effective when the relationship between features and the target is nonlinear and complex.
- **Medium to Large-sized Datasets**: Works well with datasets where the number of samples and features is moderate to large.
- **Datasets with Missing Values**: Capable of handling missing data when configured appropriately.
- **High-Dimensional Data**: With the `max_features` parameter, it can efficiently handle datasets with a large number of features.

### 2. How did you test your model to determine if it is working reasonably correctly?

We conducted comprehensive testing across multiple datasets and scenarios:

- **Synthetic Datasets**: Tested on synthetic datasets for both regression and classification to evaluate performance on known patterns.

- **Real-world Datasets**: Applied the model to real-world datasets to assess its effectiveness.

- **Datasets with Specific Challenges**:

  - **Small Dataset**: Verified model performance on minimal data to ensure it doesn't overfit or underfit.

  - **Dataset with Multicollinearity**: Evaluated how the model handles highly correlated features.

  - **Large Dataset with More Features**: Assessed scalability and performance on high-dimensional data.

  - **Missing Values**: Tested the model's ability to handle datasets with missing values using built-in mechanisms.

- **Classification Testing**: Created `test_classification_check.py` to specifically test the classification capabilities of the model, comparing performance with scikit-learn's `GradientBoostingClassifier`.

- **Comparison with Scikit-Learn**: Compared the custom implementation's performance with scikit-learn's `GradientBoostingRegressor` and `GradientBoostingClassifier` using appropriate metrics.

- **Visualization**: Plotted learning curves and feature importances to understand the model's training process and feature utilization.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculated multiple metrics such as MSE, MAE, RÂ² score, Accuracy, and Log Loss to get a comprehensive view of the model's performance.

The tests showed that the custom model's performance is comparable to scikit-learn's implementations, indicating that it is working correctly.

### 3. What parameters have you exposed to users of your implementation in order to tune performance?

The following hyperparameters are exposed:

- **loss**: Specifies the loss function to be optimized. Options are `'squared_error'` for regression and `'logistic'` for classification.

- **n_estimators**: Number of trees to be built in the ensemble.

- **learning_rate**: The contribution of each tree to the final model.

- **max_depth**: Maximum depth of each decision tree.

- **min_samples_split**: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.

- **min_samples_leaf**: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.

- **subsample**: Fraction of samples to be used for fitting each base learner.

- **max_features**: Number of features to consider when looking for the best split.

  - **Options**: An integer, a float (fraction of features), `'sqrt'`, `'log2'`, or `None`.

- **handle_missing**: Strategy for handling missing values.

  - **Options**: `'none'` (no handling), `'mean'` (mean imputation), `'median'` (median imputation).

**Usage Examples**:

- **Choosing the Loss Function**:

  - Regression:

    ```python
    gb = GradientBoosting(loss='squared_error', n_estimators=100)
    ```

  - Classification:

    ```python
    gb = GradientBoosting(loss='logistic', n_estimators=100)
    ```

- **Adjusting Learning Rate and Number of Estimators**:

  ```python
  gb = GradientBoosting(n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.05)
  ```

- **Controlling Tree Complexity**:

  ```python
  gb = GradientBoosting(max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=2)
  ```

- **Implementing Subsampling for Stochastic Gradient Boosting**:

  ```python
  gb = GradientBoosting(subsample=0.8)
  ```

- **Handling High Dimensionality**:

  ```python
  gb = GradientBoosting(max_features='sqrt')
  ```

- **Handling Missing Values**:

  ```python
  gb = GradientBoosting(handle_missing='mean')
  ```

### 4. Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental to the model?

**Challenges Addressed**:

- **Large Datasets**: The implementation includes optimizations such as limiting the number of features considered at each split (`max_features`) and subsampling (`subsample`) to handle large datasets more efficiently.

- **High Dimensionality**: By introducing the `max_features` parameter and optimizing code, the model can handle high-dimensional data effectively.

- **Missing Values**: Added the `handle_missing` parameter and updated tree methods to handle missing values during splitting and prediction.

**Remaining Challenges**:

- **Multi-Class Classification**: Currently, the implementation supports binary classification only. Extending to multi-class classification would require significant modifications.

- **Computational Efficiency**: The custom implementation may still be slower than optimized libraries like scikit-learn due to the lack of low-level optimizations and compiled code.

- **Advanced Features**: Features like parallel processing, GPU acceleration, or handling categorical variables natively are not yet implemented.
