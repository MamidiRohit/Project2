## Boosting Trees
* __What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?__<br />
The gradient boosting tree I have implemented is one of the machine learning methods that can predict the regression. Since the gradient boosting algorithm trains data by combining several weak learners, I first created `DcisionTreeRegressor` class that is applied to predict the regression data by decision tree to support a learner that the gradient boosting algorithm can integrate. 
  
* __How did you test your model to determine if it is working reasonably correctly?__<br />
  
* __What parameters have you exposed to users of your implementation in order to tune performance? (Also perhaps provide some basic usage examples.)__<br />
  
* __Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental?__<br />
