## 1. Introduction 

What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?

### 1.1 Model description:
#### Ensemble methods
When predicting a target variable with any machine learning method, we aim to minimize the primary sources of difference between actual and predicted values, which are noise, variance, and bias and *Ensemble methods* help reduce variance and bias.
An ensemble is essentially a collection of models that combine their predictions (e.g., by taking the mean) to produce a final output. The benefit of using ensembles is that multiple models focused on the same target variable tend to outperform any single predictor. Ensemble techniques are divided into *Bagging* and *Boosting*. 
In Boosting, predictors are built sequentially rather than independently. Boosting works by having each new predictor learn from the mistakes of the previous ones. As a result, observations with higher errors in earlier models are more likely to be emphasized in subsequent models, allowing the algorithm to better correct its errors. However, itâ€™s important to carefully select a stopping criterion to avoid overfitting on the training data.
Gradient boosting is a boosting model technique for regression and classification problems. It produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically *decision trees*.

#### Decision trees
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure used to make decisions or predictions. It consists of nodes representing decisions or tests on attributes, branches representing the outcome of these decisions, and leaf nodes representing final outcomes or predictions. Each internal node corresponds to a test on an attribute, each branch corresponds to the result of the test, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label or a continuous value.
T
##### The process of creating a decision tree involves:
- Selecting the Best Attribute: Using a metric like Gini impurity, entropy, variance reduction or information gain, the best attribute to split the data is selected.
- Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into subsets based on the selected attribute.
- Repeating the Process: The process is repeated recursively for each subset, creating a new internal node or leaf node until a stopping criterion is met.

##### Metrics for splitting -
To decide which feature to be considered as the root node and which feature should be the next decision node and so on, information gain of each feature is used. The feature which has maximum information gain will be considered as the root node.

__Information gain for regression__: 
For regression, information gain is based on the reduction in variance. A split is preferred if it significantly reduces the variance, as this means the target values are more predictable.

![Information_Gain_Regression](./images/Information_Gain_regression.jpg)

where
- Variance(Parent): Variance of the target variable in the parent node.
- Variance(Child): Variance of the target variable in the ith child node
- N(i) and N: Number of samples in the ith child and parent, respectively

__Variance__:
To calulate the variance we are using numpy.var() function. It measures the spread of data around its mean. Its formula is:

![Variance](./images/variance.jpg)

where
- y(i) represents individual data points.
- yhat - mean of y
- N is the number of data points

__Information gain for classification__: 
For classification, information gain is calculated using entropy:

![Information_Gain_Classification](./images/Information_gain_classification.jpg)

where
- H(Parent): Entropy of the parent node.
- H(Child): Entropy the ith child node

__Entropy__: Entropy is a measure of disorder or impurity in the given dataset. It is calculated as

![Entropy_formula](./images/entropy.jpg)

where
p(X) is the number of times the class X has occured in that node divided by the total number of nodes

![p(x)](./images/p(x).jpg)

Entropy values can fall between 0 and 1. If all samples in data set, belong to one class, then entropy will equal zero. If half of the samples are classified as one class and the other half are in another class, entropy will be at its highest at 1. In order to select the *best feature* to split on and find the *optimal decision tree*, the *attribute with the smallest amount of entropy is used*.

#### Gradient Boosting
- Gradient Boosting is a machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner. Each tree corrects the errors of its predecessors, and the model combines them to make predictions. It is particularly effective for regression and classification tasks by minimizing a chosen loss function.
- Decision trees, typically shallow (with limited depth), are used as weak learners in Gradient Boosting. These trees focus on learning patterns in the residuals/errors from previous iterations.
- Each tree improves upon the previous ones by focusing on the hardest-to-predict examples.
- The ensemble of trees produces strong predictions by combining their outputs.
- This iterative error-correction process allows Gradient Boosting to create a accurate predictive model.
- when to use gradient boosting
  * Nonlinear Relationships: It captures complex patterns and interactions between features.
  * Noisy or Medium-sized Datasets: Works well with moderately large datasets where interpretability is less of a concern.
  * Feature Importance: Gradient Boosting can provide insights into feature importance in the dataset.

- learning rate - default value set to 0.1
- max_depth - default value set to 3
- min_samples_split - default value set to 2

## 4. Future scope
Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental?

- __Optimization for Faster Execution__:
Given more time, efforts could focus on optimizing the current implementation to reduce runtime. By optimizing algorithm parameters and employing efficient data structures, the model's training time can be minimized, making it more suitable for real-world applications where fast performance is crucial.
- __Versatile Model Design for Regression and Classification__:
Developing the algorithm as a flexible class that accommodates both regression and classification tasks would significantly enhance its versatility. This approach would allow the model to adapt to various problem types with minimal adjustments, making it a more robust and reusable tool.
- __Enhanced Data Cleaning and Preprocessing__:
With more resources allocated to data cleaning and feature engineering, the quality of input data can be improved, which would likely yield better model performance. This process might include handling outliers, refining feature selection, and scaling features effectively, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.
