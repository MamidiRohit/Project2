### Introduction
## Heart Arthemia Prediction Using Model Selection using 



### Usage of Model Selection

## 1. Do your cross-validation and bootstrapping model selectors agree with a simpler model selector like AIC in simple cases (like linear regression)?


## 2. In what cases might the methods you've written fail or give incorrect or undesirable results?


## 3. What could you implement given more time to mitigate these cases or help users of your methods?


## 4. What parameters have you exposed to your users in order to use your model selectors.
